    <p>Mario Oddessey is the latest installement in the Mario franchise. This game is a improvment over others in the series like Mario 64 and Mario Sunshine because when you collect the Moons (power source) you do not get booted out of the level and can keep playing.  This was something that annoyed a lot of players in Mario 64 and Mario Sunshine.</p>
