  <p class="centerItems">I grew up playing Nintendo Games although I may not be a top notch expert I am still proud of the knowledge that I hold of the many franchises that Nintendo has created.  I am always happy to talk about anything Nintendo related and share my knowledge as well as learn some new things that maybe I was not aware of.  </p>
